//! A program the checker accepts must also build.
//!
//! `hale check` passing and `hale build` failing is the worst
//! failure mode the toolchain has: the error arrives late, from a
//! different layer, usually without a source location, and it tells
//! the author their *working* program is unbuildable.
//!
//! Three of these were found in a single afternoon, by accident,
//! while writing ordinary example code:
//!
//!   * `restart(c) for N` — checked, modelled in the artifact, and
//!     refused by codegen ("recovery modifier not lowered")
//!   * `handler: u` naming a sibling param — checked, then "unknown
//!     identifier `u`" with no location
//!   * `std::http::Server { port: 9100 }` — checked, then "param
//!     `handler` is required"
//!
//! They shared a hiding place. The 92 fixtures under
//! `tests/fixtures/examples/` are compiled and RUN by
//! `corpus_oracle`, but the ~1400 programs embedded in Rust test
//! strings were only ever typechecked — and all three lived there.
//!
//! So this closes the gap: every embedded program the checker
//! accepts is put through codegen. Two exclusions, both principled:
//!
//!   * programs the checker REJECTS are diagnostic fixtures; being
//!     unbuildable is their purpose;
//!   * programs with no entry point cannot be built by definition;
//!   * programs that `import` a sibling seed, because the harvester
//!     takes one seed at a time — the other half is not present, so
//!     "unknown qualified name `t::Intent`" is the harvester
//!     speaking, not the compiler.
//!
//! Slow (it lowers and links each one), so it is `#[ignore]`d like
//! the oracle's sanitizer sweep and run explicitly in CI.
//!
//! ## The other direction (GH #779)
//!
//! `strict_check_refuses_nothing_the_build_accepts` walks the same
//! corpus for the converse failure: `hale check <dir>` refusing a
//! program `hale build` accepts. It is NOT ignored, because it only
//! builds the programs the strict rule refuses — a handful, not 1400.
