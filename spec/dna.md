# DNA

DNA is the part of a Hale application that governs how the application
changes. It ships as a library inside the toolchain (`vendor/dna`, the
`dna/core` seed of the hale repository) and as the `hale dna` commands.
This file specifies what the library and the commands promise; the
design is GH #521 and its successor #566; `docs/src/dna/` is the guide.

## The record

The Journal is a git branch, `refs/dna/journal`, in the governed
repository:

- **One commit per event.** The commit's tree holds `journal.jsonl`,
  every event so far, one JSON object per line: `seq`, `kind`,
  `entity`, `body`, `author`. The commit's subject is `<kind> <entity>`.
- **The commit DAG is the chain.** An event's digest is its commit;
  its `prev` is the parent; the first event has no parent. Integrity
  is git's: the ref resolves, and its commit count is the event count.
- **Append is compare-and-swap on the ref.** A writer builds the next
  commit on the head it read and updates the ref with that head as the
  expected old value. A writer that lost the race reloads and, when it
  was appending at the tail, re-appends at the new tail; `seq` is the
  position in the record, never a promise made before the append.
- **Authorship is git's.** The organism's own events carry its
  configured author; a human's facts (a verdict, an intent through the
  CLI, a host's crash accounting) carry the git identity of whoever
  ran the command. Commit signing, where the repository requires it,
  applies unchanged.
- **Receipts** are blobs under `refs/dna/receipts/<sha256>`, filed by
  the digest of their content: a verification step's output, a diff
  document. Events name receipts by digest.
- **Leases** are blobs under `refs/dna/lease/<key>` (`:` in a key
  becomes `/`), `holder`, `token`, `expires`, `present` on four lines,
  compare-and-swapped on the ref. Tokens are monotonic per key.
- **Fetch and push `refs/dna/*`** to share the record. A plain clone
  has no record until it fetches the refspec.

`.hale/dna/` holds only what is not the record: the membrane sockets,
the status projection, worktrees, scratch inputs to the toolchain.
Deleting it loses nothing the record holds.

## Event kinds

`application.attached`, `structure.observed`, `responsibility.proposed`,
`law.deferred`, `intent.offered`, `intent.refused`, `task.born`,
`task.<state>`, `mutation.proposed`, `mutation.worktree`,
`mutation.located`, `mutation.candidate`, `mutation.<disposition>`,
`mutation.applied`, `mutation.retained`, `mutation.rolled_back`,
`mutation.rejected`, `mutation.revise`, `mutation.refused`,
`mutation.failed`, `effect.requested`, `effect.result`,
`evidence.<step>`, `evidence.magnitude`, `review.requested`,
`review.settled`, `review.refused`, `expression.restart_requested`,
`expression.restarted`, `expression.observed`, `expression.crashed`,
`pressure.raised`, `pressure.remeasured`, `appendage.proposed`,
`model.called`. Their bodies are documented in the guide's reference
chapter; the set grows by ordinary change, and a reader that meets an
unknown kind must keep walking.

## Storage interfaces

`Journal` (ordered append with an expected revision, read by index,
chain verification), `Coordination` (leases with fencing tokens) and
`Receipts` (content-addressed store and read) are interfaces in the
core. The git-backed implementations are the ones an assembly wires
for an organism; the in-memory ones exist for tests.
