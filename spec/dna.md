# DNA

DNA is the part of a Hale application that governs how the application
changes. It ships as a library inside the toolchain (`vendor/dna`, the
`dna/core` seed of the hale repository) and as the `hale dna` commands.
This file specifies what the library and the commands promise; the
design is GH #521 and its successor #566; `docs/src/dna/` is the guide.

## The record

The Journal is a git branch, `refs/dna/journal`, in the governed
repository:

- **One commit per event.** The commit's tree holds `journal.jsonl`,
  every event so far, one JSON object per line: `seq`, `kind`,
  `entity`, `body`, `author`. The commit's subject is `<kind> <entity>`.
- **The commit DAG is the chain.** An event's digest is its commit;
  its `prev` is the parent; the first event has no parent. Integrity
  is git's: the ref resolves, and its commit count is the event count.
- **Append is compare-and-swap on the ref.** A writer builds the next
  commit on the head it read and updates the ref with that head as the
  expected old value. A writer that lost the race reloads and, when it
  was appending at the tail, re-appends at the new tail; `seq` is the
  position in the record, never a promise made before the append.
- **Authorship is git's.** The organism's own events carry its
  configured author; a human's facts (a verdict, an intent through the
  CLI, a host's crash accounting) carry the git identity of whoever
  ran the command. Commit signing, where the repository requires it,
  applies unchanged.
- **Receipts** are blobs under `refs/dna/receipts/<sha256>`, filed by
  the digest of their content: a verification step's output, a diff
  document. Events name receipts by digest.
- **Leases** are blobs under `refs/dna/lease/<key>` (`:` in a key
  becomes `/`), `holder`, `token`, `expires`, `present` on four lines,
  compare-and-swapped on the ref. Tokens are monotonic per key.
- **Sync.** `hale dna sync` (and the host, every tick) fetches the
  remote's record into `refs/dna/remote/journal`, reconciles, and
  pushes. Local ahead: push. Remote ahead: fast-forward. Diverged: the
  local-only events are re-appended on top of the remote's head, bodies
  and authors unchanged, `seq` their new position, then pushed; a push
  the remote refuses is fetched and reconciled again. Receipts travel
  by refspec both ways. The remote is `dna.remote` in git config, or
  `origin`. A plain clone has no record until it syncs.
- **The membrane over the record.** From a clone with no organism,
  `hale dna ask` appends `intent.requested` (the body: outcome, from,
  to) and a verdict appends `review.verdict` (the body: the verdict as
  the socket membrane carries it), each in the appender's git identity;
  the host beside the organism relays unanswered rows onto the
  membrane once, and the organism's answers (`intent.offered`,
  `task.born`, `review.settled`, `review.refused`) return the same way.
  A row is answered when a later row of the answering kind names its
  entity. `hale dna ask --no-wait` appends and returns.

`.hale/dna/` holds only what is not the record: the membrane sockets,
the status projection, worktrees, scratch inputs to the toolchain.
Deleting it loses nothing the record holds.

## Event kinds

`application.attached`, `structure.observed`, `responsibility.proposed`,
`law.deferred`, `intent.requested`, `intent.offered`, `intent.refused`,
`review.verdict`, `task.born`,
`task.<state>`, `mutation.proposed`, `mutation.worktree`,
`mutation.located`, `mutation.candidate`, `mutation.<disposition>`,
`mutation.applied`, `mutation.retained`, `mutation.rolled_back`,
`mutation.rejected`, `mutation.revise`, `mutation.refused`,
`mutation.failed`, `effect.requested`, `effect.result`,
`evidence.<step>`, `evidence.magnitude`, `review.requested`,
`review.settled`, `review.refused`, `expression.restart_requested`,
`expression.deployed`, `expression.restarted`, `expression.observed`,
`expression.crashed`, `pressure.raised`, `pressure.remeasured`,
`appendage.proposed`, `model.called`, `github.pr`, `github.commented`. Their bodies are documented in the guide's reference
chapter; the set grows by ordinary change, and a reader that meets an
unknown kind must keep walking.

## Storage interfaces

`Journal` (ordered append with an expected revision, read by index,
chain verification), `Coordination` (leases with fencing tokens) and
`Receipts` (content-addressed store and read) are interfaces in the
core. The git-backed implementations are the ones an assembly wires
for an organism; the in-memory ones exist for tests.

## The organization

The organism is an organization written in Hale (GH #566 F2): a
program at `dna/org` that `hale dna init` generates and `hale dna run`
runs. The application it oversees is not modified by `init` and
contains none of it; it is observed like any Hale binary. The
manifest declares two environments, the application's and the
organization's (`[claims] no_base = true`; each adopts its own law).

- **Positions are loci; routing is the bus.** `Board` (the human
  authority: intent enters through it, escalations and reports leave
  through it, it owns every grant), `Leader` (a model-backed position
  holding the project's grant: it decides the Reviews inside the grant
  by reading the source diff and the semantic diff, and its verdict is
  a model call with evidence), and the substrate `Dna` (the record,
  the gateways, verification, the editing position, the Reviews). A
  Review is announced as a typed `ReviewRequested` fact carrying what
  a deciding position needs.
- **Authorities are ranked**: `board` (4, `maintainer` is its older
  name), `leader` (3), `supervisor` (2), `reviewer` (1). A claimed
  authority satisfies a requirement of its rank or below; an unknown
  name satisfies only itself.
- **Who decides.** `OrgPolicy`: a change that touches law, widens
  effects or crosses ownership, or is of class `organization`,
  `constitutional`, `process-policy` or `topology`, requires the
  Board; a change outside the grant (disposition `escalate`) requires
  the Board; everything else inside the grant requires the Leader.
- **The foundational law** (`dna/org/law.hl`, generated, extendable,
  never weakened): nothing applies except through the substrate
  (`forbid reaches(positions, effects(genome_apply)) avoiding
  substrate`); the editing position reaches neither `repo_write`,
  `worktree_io`, `genome_apply` nor the Knowledge; the Leader's
  verdict reaches the genome only through the substrate; credentials
  are sealed. The claim engine follows bus edges, so a position that
  could reach an effect through a published fact is a build failure
  with the path as its witness.
- **Hosts.** `hale dna run` builds and runs the organization with iris
  attached; `hale dna dev` runs the application under the same host
  too, rebuilds and restarts it on an apply, records
  `expression.restarted` in the host's name, watches the window and
  reports on the membrane. The host writes `org.pid` and `app.pid`
  under `.hale/dna`. Under `run` alone a restart request is logged,
  not answered: expressing an application deployed elsewhere is a
  deployment gateway's job.

## The organization evolves

A change of class `organization` edits the organization's own seed
(`Mutation.seed`, `dna/org`), through the same pipeline as a change
to the application: a worktree, the editing position confined to that
seed, verification of that seed (its own base artifact cut at the same
moment), the semantic diff of the organization (positions are loci,
routes are subscriptions and publications, capabilities are effect
classes), a Review that is the Board's. Applying it restarts the
organization (the restart request names the seed; the host answers
one for `dna/org` by rebuilding and restarting the organization
itself, which records `expression.restarted` at birth); the window
then judges the new organization.

Growth is initiative, not reflex: when one source raises pressure
`appendage_threshold` times, the assembly journals
`appendage.proposed` and — with `initiative` on — proposes a growth
Mutation of the organization's seed (`appendage.candidate` names
it). Nothing is grown until the Board approves the candidate commit.

`hale dna board` is the Board's queue: the Reviews only it can settle,
the proposals, the last report. `hale dna report` appends
`report.filed`, in the name of whoever asked, summarizing the record
since the previous report (proposed, reviewed, applied, retained,
rolled back, rejected, escalated, pressure, proposals, model calls and
cost, settlements). `hale dna pressure` lists the pressure raised and
answered; `hale dna pressure raise <source> <what>` publishes one
signal on the membrane's fourth topic, `PressureRaised`
(`dna.pressure.raised`).

## The editing position

`SourceEditor.perform` plans the files an objective is about — every
listed file the objective names, else the quick tier's plan from the
listing, one file per line; only a listed file is ever a target —
edits each (one model call per file, the request naming the file as
`target`), formats and checks the seed, and, when the check fails,
tries again with the diagnostics in the prompt, up to `max_tries`
in all (default 3). Each try is an attempt id (`<work>/a<n>`), so
every try's model calls are evidence in the record. The result names
the files changed and the tries taken; a proposal that does not check
within the bound is a failed Attempt with the last diagnostics.

## Backends by role

The assembly names what fills each role; `hale check` sees the wiring.

- **Record** — `Journal`: `GitJournal` (the branch), `MemJournal` (tests).
- **Membrane** — where humans see and decide: `Board` /
  `LocalHumanMembrane` over the unix sockets on one machine; the record
  itself across clones (`intent.requested`, `review.verdict` rows,
  relayed by the host); GitHub, mirrored by the host when `git config
  dna.github` names `owner/repo`: every pending mutation Review becomes
  a pull request (`github.pr`; the candidate pushed to `dna/<id>`, the
  three views as the body), every GitHub review on it becomes a
  `review.verdict` row in the reviewer's login (authority `board` when
  `dna.github.board` lists the login, else `reviewer`; each review
  once, keyed by login, commit and state), every settlement goes back
  as a comment (`github.commented`) and an approval pushes the genome.
  GitHub is a projection of the record and the record wins: a review
  whose head moved is refused here and shows as refused there.
- **Deployment** — `Deployment`: `NoDeployment` (a host expresses:
  `hale dna dev`), `ShellDeployment { command, seed }` (the command
  owns expressing and judging: `express <candidate> <seed>` returning 0
  means up and healthy, `rollback <base> <seed>` restores; the exit
  code is the observation, `expression.deployed` records it), and
  `LocalApplyDeployment` (tests). With a gateway wired, an approval
  expresses and judges in the organization's own handler and no host
  is asked; without one, `expression.restart_requested` asks the host.
- **Observation** — for a shell gateway, the command's exit; for a
  host, the window it watches; for a fleet, F5.
